## FEATURE:
Complete system audit and validation of 27 Circle MVP against specification

## TASKS:
1. Validate all user flows work end-to-end in production mode
2. Identify spec violations vs intentional dev features
3. Test all time-based states with NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_TIME_OFFSET
4. Verify data persistence and storage patterns
5. Document what's actually broken vs what works differently

## EXAMPLES:
examples/
├── correct_time_display.ts    # How times should display
├── button_states.ts           # Expected button state transitions
├── auth_flow.ts              # Production auth requirements
└── storage_patterns.ts       # Proper storage utility usage

## DOCUMENTATION:
- initial-V4.md (complete spec)
- Current codebase implementation
- Essential schema and data models

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- Many "issues" may be intentional dev features
- Production mode on Vercel is the testing environment
- Dev utilities should remain for local development
- Focus on actual bugs, not architectural preferences
