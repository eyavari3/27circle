# PRP: System Audit and Validation

## Overview
Complete system audit and validation of 27 Circle MVP against the initial-V4.md specification to identify actual bugs versus intentional development features.

## Core Requirements

### 1. User Flow Validation
- Test all user journeys end-to-end in production mode
- Document each flow's current behavior vs expected behavior
- Identify genuine breaks vs working alternatives

### 2. Time-Based State Testing
- Use NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_TIME_OFFSET to test all temporal states
- Verify circle creation, progression, and completion flows
- Test daily action transitions and state persistence

### 3. Data Persistence Audit
- Verify Supabase data storage patterns
- Check local storage usage for draft states
- Validate auth state persistence across sessions

### 4. Feature Compliance Matrix
- Create checklist of all specified features
- Mark as: Working as Specified | Working Differently | Broken
- Document intentional deviations with rationale

### 5. Production Environment Testing
- All tests must run on Vercel deployment
- Document environment-specific behaviors
- Verify no dev-only features leak to production

## Detailed Test Scenarios

### Authentication Flow
1. New user registration
2. Email verification process
3. Login persistence
4. Logout and session cleanup
5. Protected route access

### Circle Lifecycle
1. Circle creation from different entry points
2. Habit selection and customization
3. Daily action logging
4. Progress visualization
5. Circle completion at day 27

### Time-Based Features
1. Daily action availability reset
2. Missed day handling
3. Time zone considerations
4. Progress calculations

### Data Integrity
1. User profile completeness
2. Circle data consistency
3. Action history accuracy
4. Stats calculation correctness

## Deliverables

### 1. Audit Report Structure
```markdown
# 27 Circle MVP Audit Report

## Executive Summary
- Overall compliance percentage
- Critical issues count
- Non-critical deviations count

## Detailed Findings

### Working as Specified
- Feature name
- Test evidence
- Notes

### Working Differently (Intentional)
- Feature name
- Specified behavior
- Actual behavior
- Rationale for deviation

### Broken Features
- Feature name
- Expected behavior
- Actual behavior
- Severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- Recommended fix

## Test Evidence
- Screenshots
- Console logs
- Database queries
- User journey recordings
```

### 2. Test Harness
- Automated test suite for regression testing
- Time-based test utilities
- Production environment test runner

### 3. Fix Priority List
- Critical: Blocks core functionality
- High: Degrades user experience
- Medium: Spec deviation but functional
- Low: Minor polish issues

## Testing Methodology

### Manual Testing Protocol
1. Clear browser data
2. Access production URL
3. Follow test scenario steps
4. Document results with evidence
5. Repeat with time offsets

### Automated Testing
1. E2E tests for critical paths
2. API endpoint validation
3. Database constraint verification
4. Performance benchmarks

### Time-Based Testing
```bash
# Test different circle stages
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_TIME_OFFSET=0 # Day 1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_TIME_OFFSET=604800000 # Day 7
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_TIME_OFFSET=1209600000 # Day 14
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_TIME_OFFSET=2332800000 # Day 27
```

## Acceptance Criteria
