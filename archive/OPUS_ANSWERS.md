# Answers to Opus's Questions

**Q: Is RLS currently enabled on the users table? And if so, what policies are defined for it?**
A: RLS is enabled on the users table with policies for authenticated users to read/update their own profiles.

**Q: In your ensureUserProfile and joinWaitlist functions, are you already using the service client (with service role key) or the regular client?**
A: They're currently using the regular client, which is why we're getting permission denied errors.

**Q: When users hit the "join waitlist" flow, are they authenticated (logged in) at that point, or is this happening for anonymous users?**
A: Users are authenticated when joining waitlists, but the auth context isn't properly propagating to the database.

**Q: Does your users table have any triggers, functions, or foreign key constraints that might be causing issues even with service role access?**
A: No complex triggers or constraints that would interfere with service role access.

**Q: Is the permission denied error happening on INSERT (new user profile) or UPDATE (existing profile), or both?**
A: Both INSERT and UPDATE operations are failing with permission denied errors.

**Q: What is the exact error message, including any codes or details from Supabase?**
A: "permission denied for table users" - standard PostgreSQL permission error.

**Q: Can you share the code snippets for ensureUserProfile and joinWaitlist functions?**
A: These functions are in src/app/circles/actions.ts and use the regular Supabase client.

**Q: Is the 'users' table a custom table or referring to auth.users?**
A: It's a custom users table, separate from Supabase's auth.users.

**Q: How are you initializing and using the Supabase service client (with service role key)?**
A: We have a service client in lib/supabase/server.ts that uses SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY.

**Q: Have you confirmed the service role has full permissions on the users table via Supabase dashboard?**
A: Yes, we tested service role permissions directly and they work fine for database operations.
