# Production-Ready Execution & Testing Plan

## **CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX BEFORE PRODUCTION**

### 1. **GPS Coordinate Assignment Problem**
**Current Issue**: All circles get the same `location_id` (hardcoded as 1)
**Impact**: All groups would meet at the same GPS coordinates!

### 2. **Location Availability Tracking**
**Current Issue**: No system to track which locations are in use
**Impact**: Multiple circles could be assigned to the same location at the same time

### 3. **Conversation Spark Assignment**
**Current Issue**: All circles get the same `conversation_spark_id` (hardcoded as 1)
**Impact**: All groups have the same conversation starter

### 4. **Production Cron Job Setup**
**Current Issue**: No actual cron job scheduled
**Impact**: Matching won't run automatically at deadlines

### 5. **Error Recovery**
**Current Issue**: No retry mechanism if matching fails
**Impact**: Users could be left unmatched due to temporary failures

## **IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN**

### **Phase 1: Fix Location Assignment (TODAY)**

1. **Create location assignment tracking table**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE location_assignments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    location_id UUID REFERENCES locations(id),
    circle_id UUID REFERENCES circles(id),
    time_slot TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    assigned_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
    released_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    UNIQUE(location_id, time_slot)
);
```

2. **Update matching algorithm to assign unique locations**
3. **Implement location release after events end**
4. **Add validation to prevent duplicate assignments**

### **Phase 2: Test with Current 14 Users**

**Current State Check**:
```sql
-- See current waitlist distribution
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(time_slot, 'Day DD Mon HH12:MI AM') as slot,
    COUNT(*) as users_waiting
FROM waitlist_entries 
WHERE time_slot >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY time_slot
ORDER BY time_slot;

-- See which users are in waitlist
SELECT 
    we.user_id,
    u.full_name,
    TO_CHAR(we.time_slot, 'HH12:MI AM') as slot_time,
    u.gender,
    STRING_AGG(ui.interest_type, ', ') as interests
FROM waitlist_entries we
JOIN users u ON we.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN user_interests ui ON u.id = ui.user_id
WHERE we.time_slot >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY we.user_id, u.full_name, we.time_slot, u.gender
ORDER BY we.time_slot, u.full_name;
```

### **Phase 3: Complete Testing Protocol**

#### **A. Location Assignment Testing**
1. Run matching with 14 users
2. Verify each circle gets a unique location
3. Check GPS coordinates are different
4. Confirm locations are marked as "in use"

#### **B. Time Slot Testing**
1. Test 11AM deadline → 11AM circle formation
2. Test 2PM deadline → 2PM circle formation
3. Test 5PM deadline → 5PM circle formation
4. Verify locations are released after event + 20 minutes

#### **C. Edge Case Testing**
1. What happens with 1 user in a slot? (should not get matched)
2. What happens with 2 users? (minimum viable circle)
3. What happens with 5 users? (1 group of 3, 1 group of 2)
4. What happens with 13 users? (3 groups of 4, 1 unmatched)

## **CRITICAL SQL QUERIES FOR PRODUCTION MONITORING**

### **1. Pre-Deadline Check (Run at 9:55 AM, 12:55 PM, 3:55 PM)**
```sql
-- Check how many users are waiting for upcoming deadline
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(time_slot, 'HH12:MI AM') as slot,
    COUNT(*) as users_waiting,
    COUNT(*) / 4.0 as expected_circles
FROM waitlist_entries 
WHERE DATE(time_slot) = CURRENT_DATE
AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM time_slot) = [NEXT_SLOT_HOUR]
GROUP BY time_slot;
```

### **2. Post-Matching Verification (Run at 10:05 AM, 1:05 PM, 4:05 PM)**
```sql
-- Verify matching results
WITH matching_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        TO_CHAR(c.time_slot, 'HH12:MI AM') as slot,
        COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) as circles_created,
        COUNT(DISTINCT cm.user_id) as users_matched,
        COUNT(DISTINCT c.location_id) as unique_locations,
        COUNT(DISTINCT c.conversation_spark_id) as unique_sparks
    FROM circles c
    JOIN circle_members cm ON c.id = cm.circle_id
    WHERE DATE(c.time_slot) = CURRENT_DATE
    GROUP BY c.time_slot
)
SELECT 
    ms.*,
    we.waitlist_count,
    we.waitlist_count - ms.users_matched as unmatched_users
FROM matching_stats ms
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        time_slot,
        COUNT(*) as waitlist_count
    FROM waitlist_entries
    WHERE DATE(time_slot) = CURRENT_DATE
    GROUP BY time_slot
) we ON TO_CHAR(we.time_slot, 'HH12:MI AM') = ms.slot;
```

### **3. Location Conflict Check**
```sql
-- Ensure no location is assigned to multiple circles at same time
SELECT 
    l.name,
    c.time_slot,
    COUNT(*) as circles_at_location
FROM circles c
JOIN locations l ON c.location_id = l.id
WHERE DATE(c.time_slot) = CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY l.name, c.time_slot
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### **4. User Experience Verification**
```sql
-- Check that all matched users can see their circle details
SELECT 
    u.full_name,
    TO_CHAR(c.time_slot, 'HH12:MI AM') as meeting_time,
    l.name as location,
    l.latitude,
    l.longitude,
    cs.spark_text
FROM circle_members cm
JOIN users u ON cm.user_id = u.id
JOIN circles c ON cm.circle_id = c.id
JOIN locations l ON c.location_id = l.id
JOIN conversation_sparks cs ON c.conversation_spark_id = cs.id
WHERE DATE(c.time_slot) = CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY c.time_slot, c.id, u.full_name;
```
