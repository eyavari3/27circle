# Discovery Questions

Based on the project analysis and identified issues, I need to understand your priorities and approach for fixing the blocking issues in the 27 Circle app.

## Q1: Should we prioritize fixing the image path issues first before any other work?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (broken images directly impact user experience and prevent testing the onboarding flow)

## Q2: Do you want to implement the authentication pages from auth-guide.md as part of this work?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (authentication is a core flow that blocks access to the main app features)

## Q3: Should we reorganize all images to follow the correct /public/images/ structure as defined in CLAUDE.md?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (following established conventions prevents future confusion and maintains consistency)

## Q4: Do you need the UI to match the mockups pixel-perfectly before considering it complete?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (the INITIAL.md specifically mentions pixel-perfect implementation)

## Q5: Should we address all 10 pitfalls from pitfall.md during this implementation phase?
**Default if unknown:** No (better to fix blocking issues first, then comprehensively address pitfalls in a dedicated phase)
