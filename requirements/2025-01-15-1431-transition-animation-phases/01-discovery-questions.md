## Q1: Should the interactive reading window (Phase 2) have a visible tap indicator or remain completely invisible?

## Q2: Should the logo collapse animation in Phase 2 use the exact same logo from the splash screen?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (provides visual continuity and seamless transition experience)

## Q3: Will the transition need to work properly when users navigate directly to the curiosity page (bypassing splash)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (robust fallback behavior is essential for direct links and browser back/forward)

## Q4: Should the Phase 3 content animations be interruptible if the user starts interacting before they complete?
**Default if unknown:** No (let animations complete for polished experience, then enable interaction)

## Q5: Does the transition need to respect the user's `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility setting?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (accessibility compliance is standard and legally important)
